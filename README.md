# Smart Email to Notion Automation

## How it works
• **Monitors your Gmail** - Automatically checks for new emails on a scheduled basis
• **AI-powered email analysis** - Uses Google Gemini to intelligently identify task and event emails while filtering out irrelevant messages
• **Structured data extraction** - Extracts key information (title, summary, sender, date, category) from relevant emails
• **Notion database creation** - Automatically creates organized entries in your Notion database for easy task and event management

## Set up steps
• **5-10 minutes setup time** - Connect your Gmail, Google Gemini API, and Notion accounts
• **Create Notion database** - Set up a database with 5 required properties (Title, Category, Date Received, Sender, Summary)
• **Configure schedule** - Choose how often to check emails (recommended: every 15 minutes)
• **Test and activate** - Run a test to ensure everything works, then activate the workflow

The workflow includes detailed setup instructions in sticky notes within the workspace, covering credential setup, database configuration, and troubleshooting tips. Perfect for automatically organizing your email-based tasks and events without manual sorting.
